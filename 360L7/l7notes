pi = 3.14|159...

e = 1x10^-7 or 1e-7

NOTE: error essentially means how many decimal places

y = sigma f(i): i = 0 --> infinity

while i + 
	y = y + f()
	yOld = y

We're not summing to infinity, we are only summing up to the precision (error) that we want.

Use assert statements to check if they pass for question 4

///////////////
while(1){
	y = y + f()
	n++; // i or n, n in this case for whatever reason
	if (){
		break
	}
}
end 
(return yold = y)
///////////////

y = sigma f(i); i = 0 --> approaching infinity


Only when you've converged down to a very small value (up to error) do you get the final value
